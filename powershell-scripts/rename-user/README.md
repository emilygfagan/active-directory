# Active Directory User Rename Script in PowerShell

This PowerShell script automates the process of renaming Active Directory user accounts in response to name changes â€” such as after marriage or divorce. It streamlines the update of key identity attributes including the user's full name, display name, logon name (sAMAccountName), and User Principal Name (UPN).      

This tool is designed to reflect real-world IT support tasks, where consistent and accurate user records are essential for both user experience and security.
